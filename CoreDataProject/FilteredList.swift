// Previous mention of ViewBuilder at https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-return-different-view-types
//	Which at the end mentions "honestly if you find yourself reaching for @ViewBuilder you should question whether youâ€™re trying to put too much into one view."
//	"The fourth solution, and the one that works best the majority of the time, is to break up your views into smaller views, then combine them together as needed:"

//	@ViewBuilder lets our containing view (whatever is using the list) send in multiple views if they want.
//	@escaping says the closure will be stored away and used later, which means Swift needs to take care of its memory.
